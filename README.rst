placeload
---------

A script to create a set of resource providers with simple inventory
and membership in some aggregates in `placement service`_, so that
subsequent requests can be made (with ``curl`` or whatever works)
to test the service.

Uses asyncio to create them quickly.

Call it like::

    placeload <placement service url> [count] [semaphore_count]

* **count** is the number of resource providers to create
* **semaphore_count** is the number of concurrent

It can be used with a `placedock`_ `container`_ if you need a quick
way to start a placement.
